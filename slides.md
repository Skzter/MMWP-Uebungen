# Overview/General Infos
- Linux family of open-source unix-like operating systems based on Linux kernel
- First release: 17.09.1991 by Linus Torvalds 
- Typically packaged as Linux distribution (distro) which includes kernel and supporting system software and libraries
- Released under GPLv2

--- 

# Kernel
- Free and open-source Unix-like kernel
- Created 1991 by Linus Torvalds and soon adopted as kernel for GNU OS
- GNU: Free replacement of Unix
  - GNU is an extensive collection of free software
  - Can be used as/for creating OS
- Most of kernel code is written in C and assembly
- Modular design: modules can be integrated as software components

---

# Kernel
- Monolithic kernel
- Old value calculation from 2018:
  - 20 million LOC for 4.14.14 kernel
  - Average US SE salary at $75k → $14.725 billion to rewrite existing code
- As of 2021 (5.11): roughly 30.34 million LOC
- Developed/maintained by community members or companies like Intel, Red Hat, IBM, Google, and many others

--- 

# Distros
- Thousands of Linux distros ([Linux Distribution Timeline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg))
- Popular distros:
  - Debian, Fedora, Linux Mint, Arch, and Ubuntu
  - Enterprise versions: Red Hat, SUSE, and ChromeOS

# History - Precursors
- Based on the UNIX operating system
  - First released in 1971 by Bell Labs
  - Shortly after its release rewritten in C for easier porting to other platforms
  - Previously shared with anyone who asked
  - By 1984 sold as proprietary software -> modification became illegal
- In response, GNU Project started in 1983:
  - Goal: Create Unix-compatible software system using entirely free software
  - Introduction of GNU General Public License:
    - Guarantees right to run, study, share, or modify software
    - Later used for Linux

---

# History - Precursors
- Other operating systems existed by then:
  - Mostly restrictive licensing
- Linus Torvalds frustrated with one of those (Minix)
  - Began working on Linux in 1991

--- 

# History - Creation
- Development of Kernel began on Minix
- Applications written for Minix were also used on Linux:
  - Thus Unix-alike
- Later, Minix components replaced by GNU applications:
  - Licensing advantages
  - Fairly low effort, as they were already Unix-compatible
- Already multiple other developers involved
- Only kernel written by Torvalds

--- 

# History - Naming
- Linus Torvalds initially called it “Freax”:
  - Blend of “free”, “freak”, and “x” (Unix)
- Original filenames included “freax”
- Administrator of fileserver used for development renamed files to “Linux”:
  - Linus initially dismissed it as too egotistical
  - Later consented it was better

--- 

# Linux Today - Range of Use
- Lots of general-purpose distros for desktop applications
- More specialized distros for specific uses:
  - Security, real-time applications, use of only free software, etc.
- Dominant use on web servers
- ChromeOS (used on Chromebooks) is also based on Linux
- At the top of Unix-based operating systems: Android

---

# Linux Today - Range of Use
- Embedded devices:
  - Routers, cameras, smart devices
  - Low cost + ease of adaptation -> highly specialized firmware
- Gaming:
  - Historically very bad coverage
  - In recent years, more games support Linux (with exceptions for some AAA titles)
  - Emulators and compatibility layers
  - Steam Deck uses Linux-based operating system

--- 

# Market Share
- Desktop: ~4.3%
- Web Servers: Estimates ranging from 40% to 90%
- Mobile Devices: ~68%
